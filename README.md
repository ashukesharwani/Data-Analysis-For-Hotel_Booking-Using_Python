### Business problem:

Hotels in cities and resorts have experienced significant cancellation rates recently. As a result, each hotel is currently dealing with a variety of problems, such as decreased revenues and less-than-optimum hotel room usage. As a result, our main objective is to provide a comprehensive business guide to handle this issue and minimize cancellation rates in order to boost the hotel's efficiency in producing income.

The major subjects of this research are an investigation of hotel booking cancellations as well as other reasons that don't affect their business or yearly income creation.

### Research Question:
 1. What are the more important influencing variables for canceled hotel reservations?
 2. How can we reduce the number of hotel reservations that get canceled?
 3. How will hotels be supported in choosing their prices and marketing strategies?

### Hypothesis:
1. When prices are higher, there are more cancellations.
2. Customers tend to cancel more frequently when there is a long waiting list.
3. The majority of customers use traditional travel agencies to book their travel.
